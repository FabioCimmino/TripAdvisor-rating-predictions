# TripAdvisor-rating-predictions

The project titled TripAdvisor Review Classification proposes the development of a model based on a Bayesian network capable of classifying the reviews provided by users relating to stays at a hotel. The data analyzed are the comments and related metadata retrieved from the TripAdvisor site.
In order to give a practical demonstration of the implemented model, an application was developed. The demo consists of two main interfaces: the first assigns a rating to a review based on the comment and the metadata entered by the user; the second allows you to view a histogram and a wordcloud of the most relevant words of a hotel.
